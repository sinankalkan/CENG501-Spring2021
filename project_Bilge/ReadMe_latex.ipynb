Paper Summary**\n","\n","In lifelong learning, if the network forgets information from old tasks during training on a new task, the network is called plastic network; on the contrary, if the network focuses on older tasks and not learning the new task, then the network is called stable network.\n","\n","In plastic networks, catastrophic forgetting is observed such that as the new taks is learned, older tasks are being forgotten. Conventionally, lifelong learning are done in three methods:\n","\n","* **Regularization-based methods:** when the experimenter wants to ensure that the network outputs do not drastically change while training on new tasks, when the old task knowledge cannot be preserved to some extent. In this respect, the paper does not need to use regularization loss since it does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting.\n","\n","* **Memory-based methods:** a dedicated memory for storing old task exemplars are needed to use them in training for new tasks. However, the paper only store taks-adaptive calibration parameters for new tasks so that catastrophic forgetting is reduced for older tasks.\n","\n","* **Dynamic network methods:** dynamically modify the network to deal with training on new tasks, usually by network expansion. However, number of parameters in such methods can quickly become very large while re-calibration based approach in the paper requires less storage and computation.\n","\n","Another approach for continual learning might be to train the network starting from the most recent task, store all parameters for for each task and repeat this procedure for each new task. In this respect, the [paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/hash/b3b43aeeacb258365cc69cdaf42a68af-Abstract.html) proposes a balanced network between a stable network and a plastic network through a calibration modules added after each convolutional layer of the base model. The base layers of the network extracts the common features on the initial task so these layers are frozen at the end of the training of the first task. On the other hand, the new tasks are learned via training only the calibration modules to make older tasks relevant to the current task, hence, number of parameters and computational cost do not increase drastically. In a sense, the proposed method promotes transfer learning via sequentially trained calibration modules and offers an efficient way to deal with the catastrophic forgetting. \n","\n","The proposed calibration modules meet the following criteria: \n","* near-zero catstrophic forgetting \n","* not drastically increased number of parameters \n","* forward transfer learning\n","\n","So the article offers a novel method that involves (re)calibrating the activation maps generated by the network trained on older tasks. Each calibration module consists of a spatial calibration module (SCM) followed by a channel-wise calibration module (CCM). The spatial calibration module learns weights to calibrate each point in the activation maps while the channel-wise calibration module learns weights to scale each channel of the activation maps to adjust the impact on further layers. \n","\n","For each task followings are stored and it has been assumed that during inference task labels are provided:\n","* After 1st task, base models conv layers\n","* For upcoming tasks since base models layers are frozen only calibration models and classifier heads are stored."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TYuhKXgwRmm8"},"source":["# **2.

Conclusion**\n","\n","Our results are aligned with paper's claims in a sense that:\n","\n","1. We did not observe significant performace degregation as the number of tasks increases, eventhough for some experiments our performance were worse than the paper's foundings.\n","\n","1. In our experiments number of parameters did not increased drastically as calimed in the paper. Only 0.9% overhead is caused by calibration modules for each newly added task compared to number of parameters of initial model.\n","\n","1. The training process intirinsically applies on forward transfer learning (see Chapter 2.2), therefore we did not discuss this claim.\n"," \n","On the  other hand, the paper claims that they could offer an effective method for CNNs' lifelong learning; however, in practice it may be noticed that it does not actually offer an efficient way for the following reasons:\n","\n","* For each task we need to keep the calibration module and the classifier head, assuming that task labels are provided during inference. However, this is not an realistic assumption, because, we dont have access to these labels in reality. In my opinion, an efficient solution should be able to increment the size of the classifier head with the same performance, i.e. a method that enables us to jointly classify among all the classes that we have learned up to that point.\n","\n","* At first I missunderstood that, since authors utilized ResNet variants, the calibration module is added after each block of ResNet. However, in reality they are added after each convolutional layer. Indeed, the resulting memory overhead caused by calibration modules are very small compared to initial model size. Still, it would be more impressive if we could add these calibrators only after each block rather than each convolutional layer."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mUhbWdDJaPc9"},"source":["# **5.
