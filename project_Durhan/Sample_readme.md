# Approximating Ground State Energies and Wave Functions of Physical Systems with Neural Networks

This readme file is an outcome of the [CENG501 (Spring 2021)](http://kovan.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~sinan/DL/) project for reproducing a paper without an implementation. See [CENG501 (Spring 2021) Project List](https://github.com/sinankalkan/CENG501-Spring2021) for a complete list of all paper reproduction projects.

# 1. Introduction
This study was presented at the Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop at the 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) on 
December, 2020. It aims at approximating the ground state energies and eigenfunctions of quantum mechanical sytems via Neural Networks. Our goal was to obtain the 
same result with the original paper.    
Introduce the paper (inc. where it is published) and describe your goal (reproducibility).

## 1.1. Paper summary

In Quantum Mechanics, the solution of the Schr√∂dinger's equation provides full knowledge of the dynamics of physical systems. However, there might be complex systems 
which may not be solved analytically such as energy levels of Helium atom. There are numerical methods to retrieve the eigenenergies of physical systems such as 
variational methods. Once the problem is reduced to a optimization problem one can use Neural Networks to solve the problem. In the literature, it is often to see the 
methods which uses trial wavefunctions and imposed boundary conditions than seek for the solutions. In this paper, however, there is no trial wavefunctions and 
boundary conditions. The problem was solved in an unsupervised manner.
