# Channel-Pruning-Guided-by-Classification-Loss-and-Feature-Importance
This readme file is an outcome of the [CENG501 (Spring 2021)](http://kovan.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~sinan/DL/) project for reproducing a paper without an implementation. See [CENG501 (Spring 2021) Project List](https://github.com/sinankalkan/CENG501-Spring2021) for a complete list of all paper reproduction projects.

# 1. Introduction

In this project we tried to implement the method proposed in the [Channel Pruning Guided by Classification Loss and Feature Importance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06757.pdf) paper from Association for the Advancement of Artificial
Intelligence,2020. In this paper, writers proposed new method for pruning channels of a CNN network taking classification loss and feature importance into account. Different from methods based on layer-by-layer prunning, writers add the classification loss for a certain channel before deciding tobe pruned or not.

## 1.1. Paper summary

This paper proposes new method for channel prunning based on feature importance and classification loss. Different from other layer-by-layer methods writers added the contribution of channel to the loss and feature importance term to the objective functio which is an optimization problem solved in 2 steps.

# 2. The method and my interpretation

## 2.1. Unfortunately we could not complete the method for the deadline but we will work on it later on. Only finetuning VGG13 is implemented for now.

Explain the original method.

## 2.2. My interpretation 

Explain the parts that were not clearly explained in the original paper and how you interpreted them.

# 3. Experiments and results

## 3.1. Experimental setup

Describe the setup of the original paper and whether you changed any settings.

## 3.2. Running the code

Explain your code & directory structure and how other people can run it.

## 3.3. Results

Present your results and compare them to the original paper. Please number your figures & tables as if this is a paper.

# 4. Conclusion

Discuss the paper in relation to the results in the paper and your results.
